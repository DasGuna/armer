Welcome to Armer Driver's documentation!
========================================

The Armer driver provides a simple mechanism for building high-level configurations to seamlessly control a broad range of manipulators under different actuation modes (simulation or physical).

Several ROS action servers, topics and services are set up by this package to enable this functionality. A summary of these can be found [here](#driver-component-summary). 

Additionally, the driver is built off the `Python Robotics Toolbox <https://qcr.github.io/code/robotics-toolbox-python>`_ and uses `Swift <https://qcr.github.io/code/swift/>`_ as a backend to simulate supported manipulators.
